# Hi, Iâ€™m @Awais-Asghar

## About Me
Iâ€™m a final-year Electrical Engineering student at NUST, currently working on Digital Chip Design at the NUST Chip Design Centre (NCDC). My core interests lie in Machine Learning, Chip Design (VLSI, Digital Design), and Embedded Systems.

## Currently Learning
Exploring FPGA development, RISC-V architecture, Embedded Linux, VLSI systems, and hardware-software co-design. Iâ€™m focused on developing efficient and scalable embedded and silicon-level solutions.

## Collaboration
Iâ€™m open to collaborations in Embedded Systems, Machine Learning, or Chip Design. Letâ€™s connect if you have exciting ideas or tech projects to work on together.
